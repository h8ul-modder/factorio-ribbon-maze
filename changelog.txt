---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 16. 03. 2019
  Features:
    - Experimental support for factorio 0.17 alpha
  Balance:
    - Minimum dead end depth for Jivolite and Crotinnium reduced from 6 to 4 (angel's refining)
  Bugfixes:

Version: 0.6.8
Date: 29. 01. 2019
  Features:
    - Merges options from illiander42's variant
    - Fish added
    - Loop chance option: Now your maze can have loops in it. Beware that adding loops reduces the number of dead ends, which means less resource patches.
    - Clearings option: gives a chance for large open areas to spawn. These will almost certainly create loops even without the imperfect maze option.
    - Oasis: Option to find mangrove-filled water at dead-ends, instead of ore or oil.
    - Settings to control mangrove density and proportion of raw/green wood
  Balance:
    - Default mangrove ratio of green to raw wood is higher
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.7
Date: 07. 12. 2018

    - Mod ores can now be put at dead ends like vanilla ores. Supports practically any mod, with manual fine-tuning for popular mods such as
      Bob's Ores, Angel's Refining, Angel's Infinite Ores, Yuoki Industries, and more. Enable with the "Dead end mod resources" setting.
      (https://github.com/h8ul-modder/factorio-ribbon-maze/issues/1)

  Features:
    - Settings to control how infinite ores from mods are handled. (https://github.com/h8ul-modder/factorio-ribbon-maze/issues/20)
    - Setting to stretch out resource richness increase. (https://github.com/h8ul-modder/factorio-ribbon-maze/issues/21)
    - Further improved spacing for oil and other resources with multi-tile collision boxes. (https://github.com/h8ul-modder/factorio-ribbon-maze/issues/27)
    - Setting to have mixed ores throughout the maze (https://github.com/h8ul-modder/factorio-ribbon-maze/issues/28)

  Bugfixes:
    - Each resource patch now uses its dedicated random number sequence as intended, so that order of chunk generation doesn't affect resources. (https://github.com/h8ul-modder/factorio-ribbon-maze/issues/14)
